/**
 * The single source of truth for trips — now backed by Supabase.
 *
 * This provider lives in the root layout, which matters more than it looks:
 * with `cacheComponents` on, Next keeps recently visited routes mounted via
 * React <Activity> instead of unmounting them. If each route held its own copy
 * of the trips state, navigating back to a route would show you a stale copy.
 * One provider above the routes avoids that entirely.
 *
 * **Writes are optimistic.** Every mutation updates local state immediately and
 * sends the row afterwards, because packing is a stream of small ticks and
 * waiting for a round trip on each one would make the checklist feel broken. If
 * a write fails, `error` is set and the whole snapshot is refetched — so the
 * screen converges on what the database actually holds rather than quietly
 * drifting from it.
 *
 * The public API is unchanged from the localStorage version on purpose: ten
 * components consume `useTrips()`, and swapping the backend shouldn't touch any
 * of them.
