/**
 * Two people, two accounts, one database — and neither can see the other's
 * trips.
 *
 * This is the one test the assignment asks for, and it is deliberately an
 * end-to-end test rather than a unit test of the policies. A unit test would
 * assert that the SQL says what I wrote; this asserts that a real browser, with
 * a real Clerk session, hitting a real Postgres with row-level security on,
 * cannot read somebody else's rows. Those are different claims, and only the
 * second one is worth anything.
 *
 * It is written to FAIL if `trips`'s select policy is loosened. That is the
 * whole point: a test that passes whether or not RLS works proves nothing. To
 * see it fail on purpose:
 *
 *   alter policy "Select own trips" on public.trips using (true);
 *
 * ...then run it again. User B's board will show User A's trip and the
 * assertion below will catch it. Put it back with:
 *
 *   alter policy "Select own trips" on public.trips
 *     using ((auth.jwt() ->> 'sub') = user_id);

 * the code input renders before a code has actually been sent, so the second
 * user got "You need to send a verification code before attempting to verify"
 * while the first sailed through. That asymmetry is the signature of a race.
 *
 * Driving a vendor's hosted form is testing the vendor. What this file is for
 * is proving row-level security fences two accounts apart, and `clerk.signIn`
 * produces exactly the same thing that matters for that — a real session whose
 * token Supabase will accept. `email_code` works without a mailbox because the
 * addresses end in `+clerk_test@example.com`, which Clerk treats as test users.
